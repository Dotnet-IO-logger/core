# See Your .NET Logs Clearly with DIOL: Easy Logging for HttpClient

For new .NET developers, debugging HTTP requests can be tricky. 
How long does it take to figure out what‚Äôs wrong? 
And how far can that journey take us?

Let me tell you a story.

## Backstory

> Disclaimer: This story is a work of fiction intended for humorous purposes. Any resemblance to actual events, locales, or persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental. The scenarios and conversations are entirely fictional and should not be taken as technical advice or factual representation.

```

*A random day...*

JD: Hey, I'm stuck! 
Your service does not work.

Support engineer: What does the error message say?

JD: It tells me to 'Please send a request with no headers'.

Support engineer: And what do you send?

JD: A request with no headers, just like it asked.

Support engineer: Can you show me an example of how you send the request?

JD: Sure, here's what I did: 
httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("no", "no");
var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("https://www.xxxxx.xx/api/yyyyy");

Support engineer: Ah, I see the problem. 
By adding a header with 'no', you're actually sending a header. 
You need to send the request without adding any headers at all. 
Just leave them empty.

*The next day...*

JD: Hey, I removed the ‚Äòno‚Äô header, and it worked! 
But now I‚Äôm lost with the response headers.

Support engineer: What headers do get back in the response?

JD: The documentation says I should get a ‚Äòyour-key‚Äô header with a key. 
I see the key, but the value is‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòSystem.String[]‚Äô? 
That can‚Äôt be right, can it?

Support engineer: How do you read the headers?

JD: Like this:

foreach (var item in response.Headers) 
{
    // I expected something like [your-key, magic_value], 
    // but I got this instead: [your-key, System.String[]]
    Debug.WriteLine(item);
}

Support engineer: ü§¶

Support engineer: That‚Äôs the type, not the value! 
You need to access the actual value, not just the type of the object.

JD: So you‚Äôre telling me ‚ÄòSystem.String[]‚Äô isn‚Äôt some newfangled encryption I need to decode?

Support engineer: No, JD, it‚Äôs just the type indicating it‚Äôs an array of strings. 
Here, let me show you how to get the actual value:

foreach (var item in response.Headers) 
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"[Key: {item.Key}, Value: {item.Value}]");
}

JD: Oh, so the real value was hiding in plain sight! 
And here I was ready to dive into the world of string arrays as if it was a treasure map‚Ä¶

Support engineer: Sometimes, the treasure is not in the ‚ÄòX‚Äô that marks the spot, but in understanding the map itself.

```

## Understanding HttpClient Logging

In the .NET ecosystem, `HttpClient` is the go-to class for sending **HTTP requests** and receiving **HTTP responses** from a resource identified by a **URI**. A common pattern is to register `HttpClient` instances using the `.AddHttpClient()` extension method, which simplifies the process of dependency injection and provides built-in logging functionality.

```c#
// In your Startup.cs or Program.cs
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

// In your service or controller where you want to use HttpClient
public class MyService
{
    private readonly HttpClient httpClient;

    public MyService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        this.httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetExternalDataAsync(string requestUri)
    {
        var response = await this.httpClient.GetAsync(requestUri);
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }
}
```

`HttpClient` logs:

* **Request Information**: The HTTP method, URL, and other request-related data.
* **Request Headers**: All the HTTP headers included in the request.
* **Response Headers**: The headers returned by the server in the response.
* **Response Information**: Status code, reason phrase, and other response details.

If you need to track any of this information, there‚Äôs no need to introduce new logging statements; the built-in features have you covered.

## Setting Up Project Logging

To see the logs produced by `HttpClient`, you need to set up your project correctly. 
This involves configuring the logging level and knowing where to look for the logs.

Configuring Logging Levels: To capture detailed logs from `HttpClient`, you need to adjust the logging level in your `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json` file. Here‚Äôs what you should include:

```json
"Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Information",
        // Trace level shows you headers
        "System.Net.Http.HttpClient": "Trace"
    }
}
```

This configuration ensures that you get the most detailed logs possible, including all the HTTP request and response information.

Once you‚Äôve set up the logging levels, you can view the logs in the following places:

* **Console**: If you‚Äôre running your application from the command line or a terminal, the logs will be displayed there.
* **Visual Studio Debug Console**: When running your application in Visual Studio, you can view the logs in the Debug Console. This is particularly useful as it allows you to see the logs in real-time while debugging.

By following these steps, you‚Äôll be able to see the HttpClient logs and gain insights into the HTTP traffic of your application.

```
info: System.Net.Http.HttpClient.MyClient.LogicalHandler[100]
      Start processing HTTP request GET https://example.com/api/data

info: System.Net.Http.HttpClient.MyClient.ClientHandler[101]
      Sending HTTP request GET https://example.com/api/data
      Request Headers:
      Accept: application/json
      User-Agent: MyHttpClient

info: System.Net.Http.HttpClient.MyClient.ClientHandler[102]
      Received HTTP response headers after 123.4567ms - OK
      Response Headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
      Server: ExampleServer

info: System.Net.Http.HttpClient.MyClient.LogicalHandler[103]
      End processing HTTP request after 123.4567ms - OK
```

## The Trouble with Too Many Logs

So, you‚Äôve got your `HttpClient` logging all set up and it‚Äôs working great. 
But here‚Äôs the thing: when you look at the console, it‚Äôs like a flood of logs from everywhere in your app. Trying to find the log you need is like looking for your favorite sock in a messy room‚Äîfrustrating, right?

And there‚Äôs another hitch: When your code talks to the internet with lots of requests at the same time, it‚Äôs super tricky to figure out which response goes with which request. It‚Äôs like listening to a bunch of people talking all at once and trying to follow each conversation.
