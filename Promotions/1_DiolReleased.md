# Title: Meet DIOL: Your new .NET Debugging Companion

## Introduction

Hello .NET Engineers! üëã

We‚Äôre thrilled to present **DIOL** (Dotnet Input-Output Logger), a new, free, and open-source tool designed to streamline your debugging process. 

With **DIOL**, real-time logging during debugging becomes effortless, requiring no code modifications or external dependencies. 

Stay tuned as we delve into the features and benefits of DIOL!

## Motivation

Debugging in .NET can be a bit of a puzzle, especially when you‚Äôre dealing with **IO** (Input/Output) operations. 

> In this context, ‚ÄúIO‚Äù refers to anything that comes from or goes to outside of your application, such as database calls, external services, file operations, and more. 

Sometimes, it‚Äôs hard to see what‚Äôs going on under the hood with these operations.

Enter **DIOL**. It‚Äôs like having **x-ray vision** for your debugging process. **DIOL** gives you real-time logs for these IO operations, so you can see exactly what‚Äôs happening, when it‚Äôs happening. No more guessing games!

## Key feature

DIOL is packed with features designed to make your debugging process as smooth as possible:

* **Zero-Touch Approach**: With DIOL, you can start logging right away. There‚Äôs no need to modify your existing code or install any external dependencies.
* **Support for Various Log Types**: DIOL supports a variety of log types, including **HTTP** requests and responses, **ASP.NET Core** (controllers and minimal API), and **SQL** (Entity Framework). And we‚Äôre not stopping there - support for Web sockets & SignalR, and gRPC is coming soon!
* **Integration with 3rd Party SDKs**: You can integrate DIOL with your favorite third-party SDKs to further enhance your debugging capabilities.

## How to Use DIOL:

Using DIOL is as simple as plug and play. Here‚Äôs how you can get started:

* **Installation**: You can find DIOL on the Visual Studio Marketplace. Just download and install it to get started.
* **Usage**: Once installed, DIOL automatically starts logging your IO operations in real time. There‚Äôs no need to modify your existing code or install any external dependencies.
* **Exploration**: You can explore the logs at your own pace, making your debugging process more efficient and less time-consuming.

Remember, DIOL is all about making your debugging process as smooth as possible. We‚Äôre excited for you to try it out and see the difference it can make!
